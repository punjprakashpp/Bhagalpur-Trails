                <h3 class="my-3">Overview</h3>
                <p>Vikramshila Setu is a significant bridge spanning the Ganges River near Bhagalpur in the Indian state of Bihar. Named after the ancient Mahavihara of Vikramashila, established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820 A.D.), the bridge is a vital transportation link in the region. It connects the towns of Barari Ghat in Bhagalpur on the south bank of the Ganges to Naugachhia on the north bank.</p>

                <h3 class="my-3">Importance</h3>
                <p>Vikramshila Setu is the sixth longest bridge over water in India and plays a crucial role in improving road connectivity in the region. It significantly reduces travel time between Bhagalpur and various destinations across the Ganges, including Purnia and Katihar. The bridge helps facilitate easier and quicker transportation, boosting local commerce and improving the daily commute for residents.</p>
                <h3 class="my-3">Construction and Connectivity</h3>
                <p>The bridge runs from Barari Ghat on the Bhagalpur side to Naugachhia on the north bank of the Ganges. It serves as a link between National Highway 80 (NH 80) and National Highway 31 (NH 31). This connectivity is essential for reducing road travel distances and easing traffic flow in the region.</p>

                <h3 class="my-3">Traffic and Future Developments</h3>
                <p>Due to increased traffic, Vikramshila Setu experiences significant congestion, leading to demands for additional infrastructure. On September 21, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a parallel four-lane road bridge over the Ganges, estimated to cost ₹1110.23 crore. This new bridge aims to alleviate traffic congestion and improve transportation efficiency.</p>
                <h3 class="my-3">Vikramshila-Kataria Rail-Cum-Road Bridge</h3>
                <p>In June 2018, the approval was granted for a 24 km-long rail-cum-road bridge between Vikramshila Railway Station (near Pirpainty, south of the Ganges) and Kataria Railway Station (near Naugachhia Railway Station, north of the Ganges). This project, estimated to cost ₹4,379.01 crore, will further enhance connectivity in the region. The rail lines on both sides of the bridge will form a Y shape, connecting towards Kataria and Naugachhia in the north and Vikramshila and Shivnarayanpur stations in the south.</p>

                <h3 class="my-3">Environmental Significance</h3>
                <p>The Vikramshila Setu lies within the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary. This area is home to the rare Gangetic dolphins, and visitors to the bridge can often spot these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. The bridge's construction takes into account the ecological significance of the sanctuary and aims to preserve the local wildlife.</p>
                <h3 class="my-3">Valuable</h3>
                <p>Vikramshila Setu is more than just a bridge; it is a lifeline for the people of Bhagalpur and surrounding areas, fostering connectivity and economic growth. With future infrastructure developments in place, including additional bridges, the region's transportation network is set to become even more efficient, benefiting both locals and travelers.</p>
