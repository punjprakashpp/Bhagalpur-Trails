                <h3 class="my-3">Overview</h3>
                <p>Rabindra Bhawan, also known historically as Tilha Kothi and Cleveland House, is a significant historical and architectural landmark located within the Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University campus in Bhagalpur, Bihar, India. Nestled on a scenic mound along the southern banks of the Ganges River, this majestic structure offers panoramic views of the city and the river, making it one of the most attractive spots in Bhagalpur.</p>
                <h3 class="my-3">History</h3>
                <h4 class="my-4">Colonial Era</h4>
                <p>The origins of Tilha Kothi trace back to 1773, when Bhagalpur was established as a district with its own collector. The first collector, Mr. James Barton, laid the foundations for what would become a prominent administrative center. In 1779, Augustus Cleveland was appointed as the Collector of Bhagalpur and subsequently occupied the Kothi. Cleveland's tenure was marked by significant administrative success, and the house was renamed "Cleveland House" in his honor.</p>

             <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>Cleveland House became a notable address during the colonial era, frequently hosting prominent visitors. Warren Hastings, the de facto Governor General of India, along with Lady Hastings, visited the house in 1780. Other distinguished guests included Sir Elijah Impey, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William in Calcutta, and Sir William Jones, the founder of the Asiatic Society.</p>
                <h4 class="my-4">Rabindranath Tagore's Visit</h4>
                <p>In February 1910, the celebrated Indian poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore visited the Kothi to attend the Third Annual Conference of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. It is believed that Tagore wrote parts of his renowned work "Gitanjali" during his stay at Tilha Kothi. In honor of Tagore's visit and his literary contributions, the Kothi was later renamed Rabindra Bhawan.</p>
